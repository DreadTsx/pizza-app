# Fast React Pizza Co. üçï

A modern, responsive, and feature-rich single-page application for ordering pizzas online.

The application fetches menu data and submits orders to a third-party API.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cart**: Add or remove pizzas from the cart, and update item quantities on the fly.
- **Order Placement**: A streamlined, multi-step form to place new orders.
- **Geolocation**: Automatically fetch the user's address using their browser's geolocation to pre-fill the address field.
- **Priority Ordering**: Option to mark an order as a priority for an additional fee.
- **Order Tracking**: Users can look up their order status using a unique order ID.
- **State Management**: Centralized and predictable state management using Redux Toolkit.
- **Client-Side Routing**: A seamless, single-page application experience powered by React Router 6.
